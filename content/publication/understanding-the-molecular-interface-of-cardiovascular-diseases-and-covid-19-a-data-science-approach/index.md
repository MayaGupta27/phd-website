abstract: Recently, mounting evidence documented an increased morbidity and
  mortality of COVID-19 in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases
  (CVDs). To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its impact in
  CVDs, we designed a text-mining analysis project to evaluate the molecular
  interfaces between COVID-19 and several known CVDs. We assembled our data
  corpus from publicly accessible databases and applied text mining to COVID-19
  symptoms, comorbidities, and human proteins impacted by COVID-19. Our
  exploration includes a statistical overview of unstructured text datasets with
  associated biomedical entities where the information extraction was assisted
  by data indexing and entity search methodologies. Using 333 human
  COVID-19-interacting proteins as entities and 8 CVDs classified by MeSH as
  categories, we examined and computed their Context Aware Semantic Analytic
  Processing (CaseOLAP) scores. Using this dataset, we determined associations
  of COVID-19 symptoms with a variety of major and minor comorbidities. Then, we
  further explored proteins at the interface of COVID-19 and 8 categories of
  CVD, evaluating relationships between the proteins and CVD categories to
  determine the proteinsâ€™ significance in each disease. We then performed
  pathway analyses on those proteins of significance and their presence in each
  of the CVD categories. For the first time, our cluster analyses determined
  which COVID-19-interacting proteins are most relevant for each CVD category.
